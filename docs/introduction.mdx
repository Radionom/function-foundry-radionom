Foundry is a framework-agnostic toolset to create and use Functions in LLM apps.

When you create **Functions** with Foundry, they are organized in `class`es called **Tools**. For example, the `Calculator` Tool contains a `calculate` Function that can be used to perform calculations by passing in a math string.

Tools and Functions can easily be passed to LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4 without writing custom JSON Schema definitions. The way they are defined allow for a generation of the JSON Schema on the fly by inferring the required arguments, names and descriptions.

## When to use Foundry?

-   Whenever you want to integrate Functions into your LLM apps without the need to write custom JSON Schema definitions.
-   You want to build LLM applications that have broad capabilities and can be used for a variety of tasks.

## Why use Foundry?

-   **Community effort**: We want to build a great community of developers that are passionate about building LLM apps. Tools are written by developers, for developers.
-   **Easy to use**: Foundry is designed to be the easiest way to expose Functions to LLMs.
-   **Customizable**: You can easily add custom Tools and Functions and use them in your LLM apps.
-   **Framework-agnostic**: Foundry can be used in combination with any framework, e.g. LangChain, LlamaIndex or directly with OpenAI's SDK.
-   **Standalone functions**: Functions can be used without the need for any LLMs or the `Foundry` class. Just install the respective Tool and call the function directly.
