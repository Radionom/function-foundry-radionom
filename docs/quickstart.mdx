    ## Installation

    First, install the base package.

    It contains core functionalities like:
    - Registering [Tools and Functions](/essentials/tools-and-functions) that should be used
    - Parsing Tools and Functions into a format the LLM can understand
    - Parsing the LLM result, pick the function that should be executed and run it

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm i @usefoundry/foundry
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add @usefoundry/foundry
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add @usefoundry/foundry
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    ## Usage

    ### 1. Register Tools and Functions

    ```typescript
    import { Foundry, pickFromTool } from '@usefoundry/foundry'

    import CsvTool from '@usefoundry/tools-file-csv'
    import CalculatorTool from '@usefoundry/tools-utils-calculator'

    const foundry = new Foundry({
      tools: [
        new CalculatorTool(),
        pickFromTool(new CsvTool(), ['writeCsvFileSync'])
      ]
    })

    ```

    ### 2. Get the function definitions for the LLM

    Foundry has a built-in method to generate the expected JSON schema with the selected functions.

    ```typescript
    const functions = foundry.getPreparedFunctions({ target: 'openai' })
    ```
